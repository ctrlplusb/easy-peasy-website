id: useStore
title: useStore(mapState, externals)
---

A [hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) granting your components access to the store's state.

## Arguments

  - `mapState` (Function, required)

    The function that is used to resolved the piece of state that your component requires. The function will receive the following arguments:

    - `state` (Object, required)

      The root state of your store.

  - `externals` (Array of any, not required)

    If your `useStore` function depends on an external value (for example a property of your component), then you should provide the respective value within this argument so that the `useStore` knows to remap your state when the respective externals change in value.

Your `mapState` can either resolve a single piece of state. If you wish to resolve multiple pieces of state then you can either call `useStore` multiple times, or if you like resolve an object within your `mapState` where each property of the object is a resolved piece of state (similar to the `connect` from `react-redux`). The examples will illustrate the various forms.

## Examples

```javascript
import { useStore } from 'easy-peasy';

const TodoList = () => {
  const todos = useStore(state => state.todos.items);
  return (
    <div>
      {todos.map((todo, idx) => <div key={idx}>{todo.text}</div>)}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Example resolving multiple values

```javascript
import { useStore } from 'easy-peasy';

const BasketTotal = () => {
  const totalPrice = useStore(state => state.basket.totalPrice);
  const netPrice = useStore(state => state.basket.netPrice);
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Total: {totalPrice}</div>
      <div>Net: {netPrice}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Example resolving multiple values via an object result

```javascript
import { useStore } from 'easy-peasy';

const BasketTotal = () => {
  const { totalPrice, netPrice } = useStore(state => ({
    totalPrice: state.basket.totalPrice,
    netPrice: state.basket.netPrice
  }));
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Total: {totalPrice}</div>
      <div>Net: {netPrice}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## A word of caution

Please be careful in the manner that you resolve values from your `mapToState`. To optimise the rendering performance of your components we use equality checking (===) to determine if the mapped state has changed.

When an action changes the piece of state your `mapState` is resolving the equality check will break, which will cause your component to re-render with the new state.

Therefore deriving state within your `mapState` in a manner that will always produce a new value (for e.g. an array) is an anti-pattern as it will break our equality checks.

```javascript
// ‚ùóÔ∏è Using .map will produce a new array instance every time mapState is called
//                                                     üëá
const productNames = useStore(state => state.products.map(x => x.name))
```

You have two options to solve the above.

Firstly, you could just return the products and then do the `.map` outside of your `mapState`:

```javascript
const products = useStore(state => state.products)
const productNames = products.map(x => x.name)
```

Alternatively you could use the [`select`](#selectselector) helper to define derived state against your model itself.

```javascript
import { select, createStore } from 'easy-peasy';

const createStore = ({
  products: [{ name: 'Boots' }],
  productNames: select(state => state.products.map(x => x.name))
});
```

Note, the same rule applies when you are using the object result form of `mapState`:

```javascript
const { productNames, total } = useStore(state => ({
  productNames: state.products.map(x => x.name), // ‚ùóÔ∏è new array every time
  total: state.basket.total
}));
```
