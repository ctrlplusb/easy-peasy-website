id: reducer
title: reducer(fn)
---

Declares a section of state to be calculated via a "standard" reducer function - as typical in Redux. This was specifically added to allow for integrations with existing libraries, or legacy Redux code.

Some 3rd party libraries, for example [`connected-react-router`](https://github.com/supasate/connected-react-router), require you to attach a reducer that they provide to your state. This helper will you achieve this.

## Arguments

  - fn (Function, required)

    The reducer function. It receives the following arguments.

    - `state` (Object, required)

      The current value of the property that the reducer was attached to.

    - `action` (Object, required)

      The action object, typically with the following shape.

      - `type` (string, required)

        The name of the action.

      - `payload` (any)

        Any payload that was provided to the action.

## Example

```javascript
import { createStore, reducer } from 'easy-peasy';

const store = createStore({
  counter: reducer((state = 1, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'INCREMENT': state + 1;
      default: return state;
    }
  })
});

store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });

store.getState().counter; // 2
```
