Firstly, install React and React DOM.

```bash
npm install react
npm install react-dom
```

> Note: please ensure you install versions >= 16.8.0 for both `react` and `react-dom`, as this library depends on the new hooks feature

Then install Easy Peasy.

```bash
npm install easy-peasy
```

You're off to the races.
